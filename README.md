# CSCI1302 Java Projects

I have created quite a few java projects in classes. However, the code has been lost because I didn't upload to Github,
and I don't have access the the computer that I wrote the code on anymore. However, I have tracked down the
project descriptions. Below, you will find the project outlines of some of the projects I completed. I got an A- in the course
and high 90s on the projects listed below.
